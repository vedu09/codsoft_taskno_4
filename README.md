<h2>Introduction :</h2>
<p>The main goal of this project is to forecast sales by looking at how much money is spent on advertising across different platforms like TV, Radio, and Newspaper. The dataset we have includes details about how much is spent on advertising on these platforms, and alongside that, it shows the actual sales that resulted from those advertising efforts. The idea is to analyze this information to create a prediction model for future sales based on advertising expenses.</p>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>In this project, the primary dataset used is the "advertising.csv" file, which serves as the cornerstone of our analysis. This dataset encapsulates information related to advertising expenditures across three distinct platforms: TV, radio, and newspaper. Each entry in the dataset is characterized by four columnsâ€”namely, 'TV', 'radio', 'newspaper', and 'sales'. The 'TV', 'radio', and 'newspaper' columns denote the corresponding advertising expenditures on these channels, while the 'sales' column represents the resultant sales figures. This structured dataset forms the basis of our exploration, allowing us to delve into the relationships between advertising investments and subsequent sales outcomes across different mediums.</p>
